# Weather or Not?
## Project Description:

Ever in the mood to get some sun? Perfer to dance in the rain? Weather or not is the app that can find the cheapest flight to the weather you're looking for. Simpily select the weather type you're looking for, and our app will find the cities that have that weather in the next 7 days, and find the cheapest flight to go expereince it. 

## Team Members:
* Jack Lawless
* Kent Valle
* Thomas Hutcheson
* Matt Martin
* John Carlo Base

### Usage
Select the weather you'd like to have while on your trip. You are able to select multiple type of weather to find your perfect vacation. Be careful though, it's very unlikely you'll find a city with snow and hot at the same time!

Weather or Not will search for the top cities in the US that have the weather you select, and present the cheapest flights from your home base to those locations. 

### Custom Cities
View our city list at URL. You can add a custom city you'd like to include in the search.
